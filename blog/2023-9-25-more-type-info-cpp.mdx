## The standard way

C+11 introduced the `typeid()` operator as a way to get runtime type information
(RTTI) on an object. It returns a `std::type_info` with a `.name()` member
function that outputs the type information as a `const char*`.

Obviously, this "name" is implementation-dependent and needs proper demangling
in order to be human-readable. This can be done through a library like
Boost's `demangle`, but the standard library provides another solution.

`std::type_index` is a `std::type_info` wrapper class whose sole function
is to be hashed into a mapping object as a key, and associated to the
human-readable version of the type that's inside the `std::type_info` object. 

Let's see an example of this word salad:

```cpp
// type_index as the key
std::unordered_map<std::type_index, std::string> type_names;
 
// the user decides how to call each type
type_names[std::type_index(typeid(int))] = "int";
type_names[std::type_index(typeid(A))] = "A";
type_names[std::type_index(typeid(B*))] = "pointer to B";
type_names[std::type_index(typeid(A*))] = "pointer to A";

int i = 1;
A a;
B *b;

fmt::print("i is {}\n", type_names[std::type_index(typeid(i))]);
fmt::print("a is {}\n", type_names[std::type_index(typeid(a))]);
fmt::print("b is {}\n", type_names[std::type_index(typeid(b))]);
fmt::print("b casted to the base class is {}\n", type_names[std::type_index(
    typeid(dynamic_cast<A*>(b)))]);
```

This would give the following output. You can also check it on
[godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/EqeEnGPb9):
```
`i` is int
`a` is A
`b` is pointer to B
`b` casted to the base class is pointer to A
```

This method bypasses demangling and assures no errors will be made when understandig
the object types. The downside, on the other hand, is evident.
The user has to define the type names for all classes, even the built-in ones.
As if this was a python's `__repr__()` member function, but global and much
more convoluted.

Another issue/gotcha with the `typeid` operator is that ignores cvr (`const`,
`volatile` and reference, `&`) qualifiers. For example:

```
std::unordered_map<std::type_index, std::string> type_names;

type_names[std::type_index(typeid(int))] = "int";

int i = 1;
fmt::print("i is {}\n", type_names[std::type_index(typeid(i))]);

int &ref_to_i = i;
fmt::print("i& is not {}\n", type_names[std::type_index(typeid(ref_to_i))]);
fmt::print("i&& is not {}\n", type_names[std::type_index(typeid(std::move(i)))]);

int const const_i = i;
fmt::print("const_i is not {}\n", type_names[std::type_index(typeid(const_i))]);
```

And the output would be:
```
`i` is int
`i&` is not int
`i&&` is not int
`const_i` is not int
```

In this example we've only stored `typeid(int)` on our `type_names` map, yet
all the other types matched with it.
A more extensive example of this, can be seen on
[this godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/6ra6x9TPM).

## Boost's way
Boost provides the `type_index.hpp` header, with a drop-in replacement for
`typeid()` that also solves the mangling issues, at least on the platforms
I've tried it on.

`type_id_runtime()` replaces the `typeid()` operator and instead of returning a
`std::type_info`, it returns a `boost::typeindex::type_info` object that has a
`.pretty_name()` member function for demangling. On the other hand, cvr
qualifiers are still ignored.

This code:
```
int i = 1;
fmt::print("`i` is:  {}\n",
            boost::typeindex::type_id_runtime(i).pretty_name());
int &lref_to_i = i;
fmt::print("`lref_to_i` is:  {}\n",
            boost::typeindex::type_id_runtime(lref_to_i).pretty_name());
fmt::print("`i` casted to a r-value reference is:  {}\n",
            boost::typeindex::type_id_runtime(std::move(i)).pretty_name());
```
will give the following output:

```
`i` is:  int
`lref_to_i` is:  int
`i` casted to a r-value reference is:  int
```

Over on [this godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/4cEzq55v6) you can see how well
`pretty_name()` does with user made data types.

Now, since Boost calls the equivalent of `typeid()` operator, `type_id_runtime()`,
there must be a compile-time equivalent, right?

### Types at compile time
Boost also provides type information at compile time with `type_id<T>()` and it
works just like `type_id_runtime()`, but instead of providing the query object
as a function parameter, you pass it as a template parameter, not without
wrapping it inside a `decltype()` call. This makes sure that the object's type
is known at compile time.

Here's the corresponding [godbolt example](https://godbolt.org/z/vevdnqac3):

```
int i = 1;
fmt::print("i is:  {}\n",
            boost::typeindex::type_id<decltype(i)>().pretty_name());

int &lref_to_i = i;
fmt::print("lref_to_i is not:  {}\n",
            boost::typeindex::type_id<decltype(lref_to_i)>()
                .pretty_name());

fmt::print("`i` casted to an r-value reference is not:  {}\n",
            boost::typeindex::type_id<decltype(std::move(i))>()
                .pretty_name());
```
And its output:
```
`i` is:  int
`lref_to_i` is not:  int
`i` casted to an r-value reference is not:  int
```

And even better is the fact that we know have access to info on the cvr
qualifiers, and we can get it with `type_id_with_cvr<T>()`:

See the [godbolt example](https://godbolt.org/z/11coq35co):
```
int i = 1;
fmt::print("i is:  {}\n",
            boost::typeindex::type_id_with_cvr<decltype(i)>().pretty_name());

int &lref_to_i = i;
fmt::print("lref_to_i is:  {}\n",
            boost::typeindex::type_id_with_cvr<decltype(lref_to_i)>()
                .pretty_name());

fmt::print("`i` casted to an r-value reference is:  {}\n",
            boost::typeindex::type_id_with_cvr<decltype(std::move(i))>()
                .pretty_name());
```
And its output:
```
`i` is:  int
`lref_to_i` is:  int&
`i` casted to an r-value reference is:  int&&
```

Obviously type information as a string at compile-time is not as useful as
during runtime, but nevertheless it's at least a good learning tool.
For example, we could use it to inspect types in godbolt, something we couldn't
do without it, as there's no godbolt debugger (and it shouldn't be).

Maybe we'll do just that in the next post.
